ESPRIT's management has requested the automation of the management of its dormitory and restaurant through a desktop application. 
The management has already installed temperature, water flow, motion, and smoke sensors, as well as a scale to weigh the restaurant's waste daily. 
The information sent by these sensors will be used to display statistics or alerts. 
The management wishes to visualize the informations in a dashboard
My task consists of managing the restaurant's inventory and visualizing out-of-stock products in a dashboard.
